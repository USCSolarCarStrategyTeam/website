The template we are adapting for our site has a ton of great content, but also
a fair bit of stuff we don't need. We shall thus adhere to this general style
guide so that we can easily distinguish between CSS we write and CSS that
originates in the template:

-All external CSS files we write should be located in the "solar-css" folder.
-Any class or id written within these CSS files should be titled following the
 format "solar-xyz"
    -For example, "#solar-header" or ".solar-title"

These practices should make it very easy for us to distinguish our CSS from the
template's CSS. Also, since we'll be more familiar with the CSS we write, this
will decrease the likelihood that we mess with code that we do not fully understand
and may have unforseen consequences.
